# Current Task: Welcome Screen Budget Period Layout Improvements

## Requirements
1. Change select budget period to horizontal layout (prevent scrolling on first screen)
2. Set default date range to 12 months based on current month
3. Implement date selection logic:
   - When start date selected, automatically set end date to 12 months later
   - Prevent end date selection beyond 12 months from start
   - Allow user to shorten range to 1-12 months

## Implementation Plan
1. ⚠️ Locate and examine welcome screen/onboarding components
2. ⚠️ Identify budget period selection component
3. ⚠️ Analyze current date selection logic
4. ⚠️ Update layout to horizontal orientation
5. ⚠️ Implement 12-month default based on current month
6. ⚠️ Add date selection constraints and auto-update logic
7. ⚠️ Test checkpoint: Human builds and tests welcome screen functionality

## Progress
- ✅ Located welcome screen components (WelcomeStep.jsx, PeriodSelector.jsx)
- ✅ Analyzed current implementation
- ✅ Fixed default date range to be exactly 12 months from current month
- ✅ Added auto-update logic for end date when start date changes
- ✅ First test successful - 12-month default works
- ✅ Implemented dynamic end date options based on start date
- ✅ Fixed layout to be more compact (span=2 instead of span=3)
- ✅ Added smart validation for end year/month changes
- ⚠️ Dropdown approach still not working correctly
- ⚠️ Creating new calendar utility for better UX

## New Approach - Calendar Utility
- Replace dropdown selectors with custom calendar component
- Allow users to select specific start date (not just month/year)
- Show two calendars side by side horizontally
- Left calendar: start date selection
- Right calendar: end date selection (limited to 12 months from start)
- More intuitive and flexible date selection

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Create new DateRangeCalendar component
2. ✅ Replace PeriodSelector usage in WelcomeStep with new calendar
3. ✅ Implement horizontal layout with two calendars
4. ✅ Add 12-month constraint logic
5. ✅ Test calendar functionality - works great!
6. ✅ Reduced header spacing from mb-24 (96px) to mb-12 (48px) to prevent scrolling
7. ✅ Removed "Select Your Budget Period" heading 
8. ✅ Increased "Start Date" and "End Date" font size from text-lg to text-2xl
9. ✅ Moved calendar closer to name input (mb-16 → mb-8, reduced by 32px)
10. ✅ Reduced name entry FormSection spacing (mb-16 → mb-4)
11. ✅ Reduced input field bottom padding (pb-4 → pb-2)
12. ⚠️ New approach: Popup calendar picker instead of always-visible calendars

## New Design Approach - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- ✅ Click "Start Date" button → popup calendar appears
- ✅ Select date → calendar closes, shows selected date
- ✅ Click "End Date" button → popup calendar appears (with constraints)
- ✅ Select date → calendar closes, shows selected date
- ✅ Remove large date range summary at bottom
- ✅ Show simple "X months budget period" text instead
- ✅ Restore original spacing (much more room available)
13. ✅ Updated DateRangePicker to use form field styling (FormGrid/FormField)
14. ✅ Made calendar popup above field (bottom-full positioning) to prevent scrolling
15. ✅ Used 50/50 column layout (6 columns each for start/end date)
16. ✅ Fixed name field styling (removed required prop, matched heading color)
17. ✅ Fixed date fields to appear side by side (added mobileSpan={6} to both fields)
18. ✅ Added "(1-12 months)" to "Select Your Budget Period" heading  
19. ✅ Enhanced calendar popup theme consistency (improved shadows for both themes)
20. ✅ Removed "Select" from heading ("Your Budget Period (1-12 months)")
21. ✅ Fixed calendar colors: dark mode = white selection on black bg, light mode = black selection on white bg
22. ✅ Fixed calendar popup background to be black (bg-black) instead of gray (bg-gray-900)

## TASK COMPLETED ✅

Welcome screen improvements successfully implemented:
- ✅ Horizontal budget period layout (no scrolling needed)
- ✅ 12-month default based on current month  
- ✅ Smart date selection constraints and auto-updates
- ✅ Elegant popup calendar interface with form field styling
- ✅ Perfect theme consistency (black/white aesthetic)
- ✅ Optimized spacing and typography
- ✅ Side-by-side date field layout

All requirements met - welcome screen is ready!

## DateRangePicker Features - UPDATED
- Form field styling matching other inputs (not dashed buttons)
- 50/50 column layout using FormGrid (6 columns each)
- Calendar popups above fields to prevent scrolling
- Click outside to close calendars
- Auto-constrains end date to 12 months from start
- Compact "X months budget period" summary
- Theme-aware styling (dark/light mode)
- Maintains all original 12-month logic

## Calendar Features Implemented
- Two calendars side by side (Start Date | End Date)
- Click any date to select start date
- End date automatically set to 12 months later when start changes
- End calendar only allows valid dates (after start, within 12 months)
- Month navigation with arrow buttons
- Visual feedback for selected dates and disabled dates
- Period summary shows selected range and duration
- Responsive design with proper spacing

## Current Analysis
- WelcomeStep.jsx: Contains FormSection with PeriodSelector
- PeriodSelector.jsx: Uses FormGrid with 4 columns (3 span each) for date selection
- Current default: start=current month/year, end=current month/next year (13 months)
- Current validation: prevents >12 months but doesn't auto-adjust end date when start changes

## Implementation Details
1. Layout is currently using FormGrid with 4 fields of span=3 (3+3+3+3=12 columns)
2. Default end date sets to next year same month (13 months instead of 12)
3. Validation only checks bounds but doesn't auto-update end date
4. Need to modify getInitialDates() and handleDateChange() logic
